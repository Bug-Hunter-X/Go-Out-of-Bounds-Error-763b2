# Go Out of Bounds Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: an out-of-bounds array access.  The `myFunc` function attempts to access an element beyond the valid index range of the array, leading to a runtime panic.

The solution demonstrates how to correctly access array elements and handle the case of an empty array.
